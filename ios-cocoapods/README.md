# iOS CocoaPods Example Project

This is a sample iOS application that demonstrates the use of CocoaPods as a dependency manager.

## 📦 Dependencies

This project uses **CocoaPods** exclusively for dependency management. The following pods are included:

### Production Dependencies
- **Alamofire** (~> 5.8) - Elegant HTTP networking library
- **SDWebImage** (~> 5.18) - Asynchronous image downloader with cache support
- **SnapKit** (~> 5.6) - Swift autolayout DSL
- **SwiftyJSON** (~> 5.0) - JSON parsing library
- **RxSwift** (~> 6.6) - Reactive programming framework
- **RxCocoa** (~> 6.6) - Reactive extensions for Cocoa

### Testing Dependencies
- **Quick** (~> 7.3) - BDD testing framework
- **Nimble** (~> 12.3) - Matcher framework for Quick

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Xcode 14.0 or later
- iOS 13.0 or later
- CocoaPods installed

### Installing CocoaPods

If you don't have CocoaPods installed, run:

```bash
sudo gem install cocoapods
```

### Setup

1. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd ios-cocoapods
```

2. Install the dependencies:
```bash
pod install
```

3. Open the workspace (not the .xcodeproj file):
```bash
open CocoaPodsExample.xcworkspace
```

### Running the App

1. Select a simulator or device in Xcode
2. Press `Cmd + R` to build and run
3. The app will display a simple interface with an image view and a "Fetch Image" button
4. Tap the button to download and display a random image using Alamofire

### Running Tests

Run tests using:
```bash
xcodebuild test -workspace CocoaPodsExample.xcworkspace -scheme CocoaPodsExample -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 14'
```

Or press `Cmd + U` in Xcode.

## 🔧 Features Demonstrated

- **Network Requests**: Using Alamofire to fetch data
- **Image Loading**: Using SDWebImage for image caching
- **Auto Layout**: Using SnapKit for programmatic constraints
- **Reactive Programming**: Using RxSwift and RxCocoa
- **Testing**: Using Quick and Nimble for BDD-style tests

## 📝 Notes

- Always open the `.xcworkspace` file, not the `.xcodeproj` file after running `pod install`
- The `Pods/` directory is generated by CocoaPods and should be added to `.gitignore`
- Run `pod update` to update dependencies to their latest compatible versions
- Run `pod outdated` to check which pods have newer versions available

## 🔗 Useful CocoaPods Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
pod install

# Update dependencies
pod update

# Update specific pod
pod update <POD_NAME>

# Check for outdated pods
pod outdated

# Search for a pod
pod search <POD_NAME>

# Check pod repo updates
pod repo update
```
